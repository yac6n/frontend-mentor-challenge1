## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to center elements with only the CSS Grid property, and also how to make an image responsive

```css
.container {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    text-align: center;
    margin: 10% 5%;
    padding: 8%;
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    height: auto;
    box-shadow: 1px 15px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

```css
.qr-code-card img {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 15px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3 school](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me understanding css grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
